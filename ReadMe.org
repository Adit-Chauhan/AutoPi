#+title: AutoPi

*AutoPi* is a driving assistance project that helps in you drive safely.
This project aims to provide an ultimate safety companion for your ride using an embedded system that combines drowsiness detection, alcohol detection, and Lidar technology to keep you and others safe on the road. The system detects whether the driver is intoxicated or sleepy and sends an alert to their loved ones for their protection.

The project utilizes smart technology to enhance road safety and prevent accidents caused by drunk or drowsy driving. The code for this project is available on GitHub, and we encourage developers to contribute and make the roads safer for everyone.

* Dependencies
  To build the AutoPi , you need the following dependencies: 
  1. CMake
  2. OpenCV
  3. pigpio
  4. Gtest

* Hardware Schematic

* Build Instructions

#+begin_src bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo ./Autopi
#+end_src


* Code Explanation
When the program start it initializes the GPIO, email sender, MQ3 sensor, camera and lidar in that order.

It will then start the persistent threads of camera sensor and lidar, and finally will start the server and wait on the requests.
** Email Sender
It initializes and logs into the server and then provides the required callbacks for sending the emails.
** MQ3 sensor
Is called on demand when a request is sent to the server and will perform a test for 10 seconds. If it detects if the person is drunk then it will send an email.
** Lidar
Lidar will give an crash message when the distance is less than a certain threshold.
** Camera
Camera will detect if the driver is drowsy and send an email if found to be so.

* Future Scope And Limitations
+ SMTP is using a proxy server instead of an actual server a proper server is needed for email to function as needed.
+ Lidar is very limited due to budget constraints, a more powerful lidar and more number of lidars working in conjunction will increase safety.
+ Alcohol detector may need to take more serious steps but that possibility is yet to be explored
